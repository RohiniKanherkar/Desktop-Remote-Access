# Desktop-Remote-Access

Computer networks significantly affect how well an organisation operates. From a daily perspective, society completely depends on the effective operation and analysis of its network for its security needs. Distance is never an issue if you have a remote desktop client with you because it allows you to view and manage linked desktops from any location in the world. The purpose of this project was to use socket programming, the Python auto GUI toolkit, and the Tkinter Library to remotely access the desktop using Python programming and the client-server TCP/IP architecture. The project offers explanations for a number of concepts, including Remote Desktop. IP address binding with port numbers, and how to remotely operate one desktop from another desktop using TCP/IP architecture.

The aim of this project is to design the a client-server is used to implement the suggested client- server TCP/IP architecture for remote desktop access. This Remote Desktop Application consists of the following:

1) Client

2) Server

3) TCP/IP Architecture

4) Socket Programming

5) Tkinter

6) Wireless Device (Access Point)

7) PCs

8) Laptops

The design includes the following parts of the TCP/IP Architecture:

⚫ Server

⚫ Client

⚫ Socket Programming
